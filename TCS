*** schedule job at 5 am and it has to delete the log files that are 10 days old ***
0 5 * * * find /var/log -type f -mtime +10 -name "*.log" -exec rm -f {} \;
📘 Explanation:
0 5 * * * → Run daily at 05:00 AM
find → searches in /var/log
-mtime +10 → files older than 10 days
-exec rm -f {} → delete each found file

*** Kubectl commmands ***
*** Image pull back off error ***
1️⃣ ImagePullBackOff Error
Meaning:
It means Kubernetes tried to pull (download) the container image from the image registry (like Docker Hub, Quay, or a private repo) but failed repeatedly.
Common Causes:
*Incorrect image name or tag
Example: nginx:alpinee (wrong spelling)
*Private image repository (authentication needed)
Missing imagePullSecret
*Network issue
Cluster node cannot connect to Docker registry.
*DNS issue
Node cannot resolve the registry hostname.

How to check:
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>

Look at the Events section; you’ll see messages like:
Failed to pull image "nginx:latest": rpc error: code = Unknown desc = Error response from daemon


Fix:
✅ Check the image name and tag
✅ If private registry → create secret:
kubectl create secret docker-registry myregistrykey \
  --docker-server=<registry-url> \
  --docker-username=<username> \
  --docker-password=<password> \
  --docker-email=<email>
Then in Pod YAML:
imagePullSecrets:
  - name: myregistrykey
✅ Check node network/DNS using:
kubectl get nodes -o wide
kubectl exec -it <pod> -- nslookup <registry-url>

2.Pod pending state
3.node not ready(all the nodes in the cluster are not ready)
4.service not reachable, how to troubleshoot
5.What is Service and types of services
6.what is pv and pvc?what happens if pod is deleted to pvc-perisitenceVolumeReclaimPolicy and command to check pv and pvc?
7.progressdeadline error-we can increase the replicas pods
we can use autoscaling Hpa(to increase pods) and vpa(to cpu and memory for existing pods)
8.Kubernetes architecture
9.you are using external ip not reachable? ans-network policies????not sure
10.How to increase cpu and memory to pod ?command
11.we have pod in one namepspace wnat to  communicate with other other namespace?-namespace selector network policies,Rbac
12.In your project how you are using RBAC


Docker
1.what is docker file?and what are the main instructions or components in docker file?from that docker file how to create image and container
2.how to delete the container that was stopped?
first check docker ps -a-status of container
docker images
docker rmi container <containerid>
