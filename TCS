*** schedule job at 5 am and it has to delete the log files that are 10 days old ***
0 5 * * * find /var/log -type f -mtime +10 -name "*.log" -exec rm -f {} \;
📘 Explanation:
0 5 * * * → Run daily at 05:00 AM
find → searches in /var/log
-mtime +10 → files older than 10 days
-exec rm -f {} → delete each found file

Kuberenetes
*** Kubectl commmands ***
*** Image pull back off error ***
1️⃣ ImagePullBackOff Error
Meaning:
It means Kubernetes tried to pull (download) the container image from the image registry (like Docker Hub, Quay, or a private repo) but failed repeatedly.
Common Causes:
*Incorrect image name or tag
Example: nginx:alpinee (wrong spelling)
*Private image repository (authentication needed)
Missing imagePullSecret
*Network issue
Cluster node cannot connect to Docker registry.
*DNS issue
Node cannot resolve the registry hostname.

How to check:
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>

Look at the Events section; you’ll see messages like:
Failed to pull image "nginx:latest": rpc error: code = Unknown desc = Error response from daemon


Fix:
✅ Check the image name and tag
✅ If private registry → create secret:
kubectl create secret docker-registry myregistrykey \
  --docker-server=<registry-url> \
  --docker-username=<username> \
  --docker-password=<password> \
  --docker-email=<email>
Then in Pod YAML:
imagePullSecrets:
  - name: myregistrykey
✅ Check node network/DNS using:
kubectl get nodes -o wide
kubectl exec -it <pod> -- nslookup <registry-url>

****Pod pending state****
A Pod in Pending state means Kubernetes accepted the request but hasn’t been able to schedule the Pod onto any node.
It is basically stuck before running.
✅ Why a Pod goes into Pending State?
Here are the most common reasons with simple explanation:
| Reason                                                             | Meaning                                          | Example                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Not enough CPU/Memory resources**                                | No node has free capacity to run the pod         | You requested `2 CPU and 4Gi memory`, but all nodes are full     |
| **No node matches nodeSelector/taints/tolerations/affinity rules** | Scheduling rules block the pod from being placed | Pod demands a node with label `env=prod` but no such node exists |
| **PVC (Persistent Volume Claim) not bound**                        | Storage request not available yet                | Your PVC is Pending → Pod also Pending                           |
| **ImagePullSecret missing for private registry**                   | Kubernetes can’t access private image            | Works only after you configure a secret                          |
| **Network policy / permissions issue**                             | Scheduler can't assign pod due to constraints    | Rare but possible                                                |

🧪 How to Troubleshoot Step-by-Step
1️⃣ Check Pod Status and Events
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
Look at the bottom: Events section — it tells the real reason.

2️⃣ Check if Resources are Available
kubectl get nodes -o wide
kubectl describe node <node-name>
If you see messages like:
0/3 nodes are available: insufficient memory / cpu
Then your requests are too high.
3️⃣ Check PVC Binding Issue
kubectl get pvc
If PVC is also Pending, fix storage before the pod runs.
4️⃣ Check Scheduling Rules
If you're using labels or taints:
kubectl get nodes --show-labels
kubectl describe node <node>
⭐ Common scheduler mismatch messages:
node(s) didn't match node selector
node(s) had taints that the pod didn't tolerate
🛠 Example Real-Life Issue
YAML:
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "2"
    memory: "4Gi"
If your node has only 1 CPU free, scheduler won't assign it, so pod stays pending.

🩹 Fix: lower the request:
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "0.5"
    memory: "512Mi"
Adjust the reource requests and limits in the deployment
kubectl edit deployment <deployment-name>


***node not ready(all the nodes in the cluster are not ready)***
It means Kubernetes cannot talk to the node, so pods cannot run on it.
📌 How to Check Node Status
kubectl get nodes
Example output:
NAME       STATUS     ROLES    AGE     VERSION
node01     NotReady   worker   20d     v1.28
node02     NotReady   worker   20d     v1.28

🛠 How to Fix It (Simple Steps)
1️⃣ Check kubelet is running
Describe the Node
kubectl describe node <node-name>
Look for messages under Conditions:
Ready: False
Reason: KubeletNotReady
Message: container runtime is down

2️⃣ SSH into the node and check Kubelet
systemctl status kubelet
If not running, start it:
sudo systemctl start kubelet
sudo systemctl enable kubelet

3️⃣ Check Node Pressure (Memory, Disk)
Node Pressure means the node is running low on memory or disk space, so Kubernetes marks it as NotReady to protect itself.

Types of Pressure:
| Pressure Type      | Meaning                             | Example                              |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **MemoryPressure** | Node is running out of RAM          | Too many pods using memory           |
| **DiskPressure**   | Node is running out of disk storage | Logs, images, or files fill the disk |

🧪 How to Check?
Run:
kubectl describe node <node-name>
If you see:
MemoryPressure: True
DiskPressure: True

🛠 How to Fix Node Pressure (Simple Steps)
✅ If Memory is Low
The node doesn't have enough RAM.
Fix: Remove extra pods or increase the size of the node.

✅ If Disk is Full
The node doesn't have enough storage.
Fix: Delete old files, logs, and unused container images.

🧹 Simple Cleanup Commands
If using Docker:
docker system prune -a
If using containerd:
crictl rmi --prune
